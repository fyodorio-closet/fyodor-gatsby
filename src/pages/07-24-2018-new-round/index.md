I've started new round of [#100DaysOfCode](http://100daysofcode.com/) challenge (woot woot!)

This time I'm gonna deal with mobile development and related technologies.

I occasionally found some information about [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) and [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/), and realized that this stack combines everything I like and eliminate everything I don't like in mobile development (both [Android](https://www.android.com/) and [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/ios/)). All sides of code in one file, static types, simple and familiar syntax and architecture, best performance for cross-platform development, good tooling, great young and hungry community, etc.

So I decided to dedicate [this round of my #100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/loenko/100-days-of-code/blob/master/r2-log.md) to Flutter and Dart. And since I'm still a web developer, or, to be specific, an [Angular](https://angular.io/) developer, I also decided to give [AngularDart](https://webdev.dartlang.org/angular) a try too. I'm gonna rebuild my 'Coder Library' app written in Angular 5 to AngularDart, adding [ngrx](https://github.com/ngrx/store) to it, 'cos I like [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/) and [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) architecture and want to use it in Angular apps.

That's my new aim, and I hope this can possibly become something bigger than a part of the challenge for me.
