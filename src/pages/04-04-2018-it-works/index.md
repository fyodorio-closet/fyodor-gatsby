The last week I tried to follow the plan and schedule [declared in the previous post](http://loenko.ru/angular-way) and managed to do this successfully and with good results.

I had started with Angular and made a good progress: I coded the app based on [official tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial) but about my coding library. By this time I had already delved into Angular components, directives, services, observables, routing and DI, learned more TypeScript awesomeness and Angular CLI powers.  

From React side I learned more about Gatsby.js-specific React features and also developed Firebase back end API for my React Contact List app. The last thing was challenging due to absence of up-to-date tutorials and poor official Firebase API description. But it was funny and extremely useful for me. Additionally I had spent a lot of time fighting with some Gatsby.js plugins, but it's a sad story (I had failed and rolled back).

I also had got my hands dirty with unit testing. I learned different aspects of TDD and BDD and applied them using Mocha and Chai. I definitely need more practice but this session was cool for beginning.

Finally, I had coded [my own Hash Table](https://github.com/loenko/js-algorithms/blob/master/7_hash_table.js) with JavaScript, [guiding article](https://hackernoon.com/data-structures-in-javascript-pt-2-hash-tables-8a6cc8ae3bd3) and an [Aditya Bhargava's book](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms).

So it's needless to say that having a plan, a schedule and a set of priorities helps a lot on any learning way, and the last week proved this concept for me in all the things.

The following week is going to be my final [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfCode) week and I'm a little nervous about it. But I guess this is a story for another blog post.
