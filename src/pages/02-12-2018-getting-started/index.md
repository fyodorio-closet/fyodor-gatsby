This is my first blog post! I'm gonna log my failures and achievements on the neverending learning way using one of the tools learnt recently - Gatsby - React-based static site generator. It's a part of my [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfCode) program which I [log daily](https://github.com/loenko/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md) and want to summarize weekly from now on.
